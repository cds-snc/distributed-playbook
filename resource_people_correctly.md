# Resource people correctly
## Working space matters
People need a place to work. Folks that join distributed often start working from home and a good home office set up makes a big difference. Once a location has 4-5 people, we start looking for space in the community. 

## Quality headphones matter
Whether working at home, in an open office, or in a coffee shop, the quality of your headphones can make or break your ability to focus on work or participate in meetings. CDS provides headphones with a mic.
